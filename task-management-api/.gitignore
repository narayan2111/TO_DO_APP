# .gitignore for the Node.js/TypeScript Task Management API Project
# ===================================================================

# 1. Dependencies
# This directory contains all third-party libraries downloaded by npm.
# It is the single heaviest folder and can be completely regenerated by
# running `npm install`, so it should NEVER be committed.
/node_modules

# 2. Build Output
# This directory contains the compiled JavaScript code generated by the
# TypeScript compiler. We only need to commit the source code in /src,
# as this folder is recreated by running `npm run build`.
/dist

# 3. Environment Variables
# This file stores sensitive information like database credentials or API keys.
# It is a major security risk to commit this file. Each developer should
# maintain their own local .env file.
.env
.env.*

# 4. Log Files
# Any log files generated during development or production.
*.log
npm-debug.log*
